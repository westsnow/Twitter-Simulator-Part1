Twitter-Simulator
=================

My Work:
- Implemented a twitter-like simulator.
- twitter server responds to millions of users' behavior: post twiter, refresh homepage timeline, etc.
- simulate different users' different behavior
  - some users has many folloers while some has quite a few.
  - some users posts twitter frequenly while some users hardly posts a twitter.
  - some are more willing to post twitters and some are more willing the read others' twitters.
  - in some special days such as Chrismas, users tend to post more often.
